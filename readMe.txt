This project demonstrates my knowledge of git and GitHub, 
a powerful version control system.

1. create a local repository and initialize it with git init command
2. branch out from the master branch using the git branch command
3. make some changes to the new branch and stage those changes using git add <file> command
4. commit the staged changes using git commit command
5. merge this new branch to the master using git merge <branch> command
6. adding a remote repository and pushing to remote in GitHub
7. branch-tracking and pulling requests: git checkout -b <remote> <branch>; git remote status show; git pull; git push
